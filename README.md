### Hi there 👋

  I am a backend dev🤖 . Primarily works with nodejs frameworks and prefer Typescript🔥  when I code. Backend and devops since I dont want to loose sleep over CSS 😅 . I use AWS at work and GCP for private projects.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting Typescript or Golang projects
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to NodeJS/Javascript/Typescript
